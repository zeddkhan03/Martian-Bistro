## Problem Statement
Welcome to Martian Bistro - a sustainable restaurant for Martians!

This project was created as a solution to the challenges facing restaurant operations in a Martian colony. One of the biggest challenges is the limited resources available, particularly the reliance on imported goods, which is not sustainable in the long run. Additionally, traditional restaurant operations require a significant amount of human labor, which can be scarce on a planet with limited human resources. Finally, the lack of a reliable payment system and the need for secure food delivery present additional obstacles.
